[Week9] Homework 7: Hierarchy Interactive Treemap
===
## The nubmer of Nobel Prize winner by category and country

### Background
The 2020 Nobel Prize was recently awarded to twelve laureates for achievements that have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.
While I was exploring the winners, one question popped into my head. "Which countries have the most Nobel Prize winners by category?"
The overall number of winners by country was easy to find online, but I realized that there is no integrated database of the number of winners by category and country. Thus, I decided to create the visualization showing the number of the Nobel Prize winners by category and country for this week's homework. I also believed that the treemap is the best way to show each country's portion clearly at a glance.

### Process
The Nobel Prize official website and the Wikipedia page provide the list of winners by category. Based on this data, I organized and calculated the laureates' nationality by category.
After the organization, I created a JSON file putting the data following the order.

### Results
The attached visualization shows the nubmer of Nobel Prize winner by category and country.
Here is a GIF image of how that displays using a tooltip.
