Final Project: NYC DOGS
===

## Intro
This project visualizes the statistics of the licensed dogs in New York City based on the dataset provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. This project’s main audience is people who want to know more about the dog populations in New York City. The goal of this project is to visually deliver relevant and actionable information to the audience with an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand analysis of the dog population in New York City.

## Dataset
I used the “NYC Dog Licensing Dataset” from NYC Open Data, which is provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).

## Results
### The overall number of dogs in NYC and dogs per capita
I only used simple text for this part because there are no comparable values. Instead, I utilized the human and dog emojis for effective and fun way to show the number of dogs per capita.

### The number of dogs by boroughs and neighborhoods
I simply used a bar chart to compare the number of dogs in each of the boroughs and neighborhoods.

###  The most popular dog breeds and names
I planned to visualize the most popular dog breeds and names using a treemap feature. However, there are a total of 319 breeds and 10,646 names without a hierarchy. Thus, I realized that the treemap would not be effective in illustrating this many values. As a result, I chose a simple bar chart with different colors.

### Pure and mixed breed ratio and gender ratio
I used a pie chart because these sets of data could only be sorted into four and three groups, respectively.

### The most unique name
In order to display nine unique names I found, I selected a bubble chart. Without any values, the bubble chart’s goal is to show the text beautifully.

### Interactive tooltips
I adopted a tooltip as my unique interactive feature for this project.
