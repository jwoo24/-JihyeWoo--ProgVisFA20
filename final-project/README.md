Final Project: NYC DOGS
===
## Based on NYC dog licensing dataset

### Intro
This project visualizes the statistics of the licensed dogs in New York City based on the dataset provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. This project’s main audience is people who want to know more about the dog populations in New York City. The goal of this project is to visually deliver relevant and actionable information to the audience with an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand analysis of the dog population in New York City.

### Dataset
I used the “NYC Dog Licensing Dataset” from NYC Open Data, which is provided by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).

### Results
####1. The overall number of dogs in NYC and dogs per capita
I only used simple text for this part (Figure 4), because there are no comparable values. Instead, I utilized the human and dog emojis for effective and fun way to show the number of dogs per capita.
