[Week4] Homework 3
===
Build SVG Paths using my own data
---

The attached visualization is an SVG path that shows the number of steps I walked last week from September 14 to 20, 2020.
A sneaker's shape path represents my steps. The more I walked, the darker the red color appears. In this homework, I successfully loaded data from a CSV file.

Here is an image of how that displays.
